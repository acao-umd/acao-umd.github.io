            <p>
                Hello, I am Anh, I am a senior computer science and math student.
                I was born in 2003 in Vietnam and moved here when I was 3.
                My hobbies include learning about and solving math problems, working on a compiler for my
                custom language, playing the piano, and listening to rock music!
            </p>

                This is the custom language I've been working on in my spare time.
                It started off parodying the real programming language 
                <a id="normal_link" href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, but soon became its own things
                after I realized I had the power to implement whatever kind of features I wanted.
                The compiler (and interpreter) are written completely in C, and currently only supports
                x86-64.

                Twitter Bots
            </h2>
            <p id="bots">
                To conduct research on Twitter bots, I worked with a group
                of other students and we bought our own 300 or so bots to observe their
                behavior and monitor their statistics. We did this over several months,
                and saw several trends in the data gathered from usernames, follower counts,
                and others.

                Markov Text Generator
            </h2>
            <p>
                When researching Markov Chains and their applications, I made a text generator
                in Python (with minimal natural language processing) using the stochastic 
                nature of Markov Chains. While it was nothing close to the generative AI and 
                chat bots we see today, the text generator was able to output (somewhat coherent)
                sentences when fed sufficient training data (like the Bee Movie script).
